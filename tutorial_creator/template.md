## Section 1 title

Section 1 opening paragraph.

One line with code example `HelloWorld.java`.

1. Ordered list item 1.
2. Ordered list item 2 with image in step 3.
3. Image title must be entered to show the figcaption. You must create a txt file for each figcaption.

    ![Image alt text](img/screenshot1.png "image title")

4. If you have a screenshot to add, and you don't want to create txt file for each figcaption, enter title as empty space.

    ![Image alt text](img/screenshot1.png " ")    

4. Do not enter image title for inline icons ![Navigation icon](img/navigation_icon.png). Steps numbering in ordered lists don't really matter. Even if the numbering is same, it renders correctly in HTML.

5. One example with bold **text**.

    If you add another paragraph, add 4 spaces before the line for proper indentation.
