# Get Started with Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service
## Before You Begin

This tutorial demonstrates how to sign in to Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service console for the first time, create a user, and copy client credentials. This tutorial takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.

### Background
Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service is a fully managed database cloud service that offers low latency, flexible, scalable, high performance, and reliable data stores for document, key-value, and table data models. As it is fully managed by Oracle, it is easy to start using the service in a matter of minutes. Developers can focus on their application development and data store requirements without dealing with the complexity of maintaining a data center or purchasing servers, storage or networks.

Unlike other Oracle Cloud services, you do not create an instance to get started with Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service. If you are the account administrator or application administrator of your Oracle Cloud subscription, you can get started by signing in to Cloud console, creating a new user, and copying client credentials to connect your application to the service.

### What Do You Need?

* Subscription to Oracle Cloud

## Activate Your Order from Your Welcome Email

When you purchase an Oracle Cloud service, you receive a welcome email from Oracle Cloud, with you designated as an activator of the services. Perform the following steps to activate your Oracle Cloud service:
