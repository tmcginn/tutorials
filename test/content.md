## Getting Started
There are a few tasks that are required to get started with Big Data Service.  Several of these tasks need to be performed by the Cloud Administrator for your tenancy.  There are also optional tasks that make it easier to manage your environment.  For example, creating compartments and groups will simplify administration tasks as your environment exapnds.

| User | Task | Purpose | Required | How to |
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|Cloud Admin| Create a Compartment for BDS Resources| Helps organize your cloud resources | No |OCI Console: Identity >> Compartments |
|Cloud Admin| Create an Admin Group for users that will manage BDS Clusters| Apply policies to groups instead of indivisual users | No | OCI Console: Identity >> Compartments |
|Cloud Admin| Create a Big Data Service Cluster Administrator | User that will manage cluster lifecycle operations | No | OCI Console:  Identity >> Users |


## Create a Compartment
Create a **Compartment** that will capture the resources used by Big Data Service.  There are other ways of organizing Oracle Cloud resources that you can also explore.

Log into the OCI console as the Cloud Administrator.  Then, 
* Select **Identity >> Compartments**
* Click **Create Compartment**.  Specify `your-compartment`, provide a description, and then click **Create Compartment**

In this example, all Big Data Service related items are going to be stored in a compartment called `bds-cluster`.

## Create a BDS Administrator Group
Create a group for you Big Data Service administrators.  You will grant privileges to this group to perform the critical administrative tasks required to manage your cluster.
* Select **Identity >> Groups**
* Click **Create Group**.  Specify `your-admin-group`, provide a description, and then click **Create Group**

In subsequent examples, we will use `bds-administrators` as the group name.

### Add an OCI User to the `bds-administrators` Group
Select a user that will be the administrator for your 

## Create Policies Required to Administer your Big Data Service Instances
### Manage Big Data Services

    allow group your-admin-group to manage bds-instance in compartment your-compartment

### Manage Virtual Cloud Networks

    allow group your-admin-group to manage virtual-network-family in compartment your-compartment


### Creating a Cluster

BDS Control Plane creates for BDS VMs VNICs to customer's subnet that is used for accessing BDS instance. Please, create following policy in your root compartment:
    
    allow service bdsprod to {VNIC_READ, VNIC_ATTACH, VNIC_CREATE, VNIC_ATTACHMENT_READ, SUBNET_READ, SUBNET_ATTACH} in compartment your-compartment

### Example
Listed below is an example of all the policies the Cloud Administrator required to set up a cluster.  It assumes that the Big Data Service administrator will also be responsible for setting up the network.  The example uses the following values for `your-*`:

* your-compartment = `bds-cluster`
* your-admin-group = `bds-administrators`

In the OCI Console navigation menu, select **Identity >> Policies**.  Ensure that you are in the `bds-cluster` compartment. Then, click **Create Policy**.  Name the policy `bds-admin-policies` and provide a description.  Then, add the following policiy statements:

```        
allow group bds-administrators to manage bds-instance in compartment bds-cluster

allow group bds-administrators to manage virtual-network-family in compartment bds-cluster

```

Create a second policy in the **root** compartment that will allow the Big Data Service to create clusters on your behalf in the `bds-cluster` compartment.  Select **Identity >> Policies**, name the policy `enable-bds-cluster`, and add the following:

```
allow service bdsprod to {VNIC_READ, VNIC_ATTACH, VNIC_CREATE, VNIC_ATTACHMENT_READ, SUBNET_READ, SUBNET_ATTACH} in compartment bds-cluster
```

## Assign a User to the `bds-administrators` Group


Cloudera amdin id, password
Utility Node 1 IP Address

## Create a Virtual Cloud Network 
In this section, you will set up the Virtal Cloud Network that will be used by your Big Data Service.  Note, you may also leverage an existing VCN if you already have one.  If you have an existing VCN, ensure it is using a Regional subnet and that the appropriate ports are opened.

### Create a VCN
* In the OCI Console navigation menu, select **Networking >> Virtual Cloud Networks**
* Click **Create Virtual Cloud Network**
    * **Name:** `your-network-name`
    * **Create in Compartment:** `your-compartment`
    * Select **CREATE VIRTUAL CLOUD NETWORK ONLY**
    * **CIDR BLOCK:** 10.0.0.0/16 (modify as required)
    * Select **Use DNS Hostnames in this VCN:** 
    * **DNS LABEL:** `beddsnetwork`
    * **Create Virtual Cloud Network**

### Create a Subnet
* Click **Create Subnet** in this VCN
    * **Name:** `your-subnet`
    * **Subnet Type:** `Regional`
    * **CIDR Block:** `10.0.0.0/24`
    * **Route Table:**  `Default Route Table for your-network`
    * Select **Public Subnet**
    * Check **Use DNS Hostnames in this Subnet**
    * **DNS Label:** `bdssubnet`
    * **DHCP Options:** `Default DHCP Options for your-network`
    * **Security List:** `Default Security List for your-network`
    * Click **Create Subnet**

### Create a NAT Gateway
A NAT gateway lets instances that don't have a public IP address access the internet.
* From the list of Resources, click **NAT Gateways**
* Click **Create NAT Gateway**
    * **Name:** `your-nat-gateway`    
    * **Create in Compartment:** `your-compartment`
    * Click **Create NAT Gateway**

### Create an Internet Gateway
An internet gateway is an optional virtual router you can add to your VCN to enable direct connectivity to the internet.  The gateway supports connections initiated from within the VCN (egress) and connections initiated from the internet (ingress).
* From the list of Resources, click **Internet Gateways**
* Click **Create Internet Gateway**
    * **Name:** `your-internet-gateway`    
    * **Create in Compartment:** `your-compartment`
    * Click **Create Internet Gateway**

### Create a Service Gateway
A service gateway enables cloud resources without public IP addresses to privately access Oracle services.  This allows a service to access the Oracle Services Network without the traffic going over the internet.
* From the list of Resources, click **Service Gateways**
* Click **Create Service Gateway**
    * **Name:** `your-service-gateway`    
    * **Create in Compartment:** `your-compartment`
    * **Services:** `All <region> Services in Oracle Services Network`
    * Click **Create Service Gateway**


### Create a Routing Rule
Add two routing rules, one for internet access and the other for the Oracle service gateway
* From the list of Resources, select **Route Tables**
* Click **Default Route Table for ``your-network``**
* Add the internet access rule.  Click **Add Route Rules**
    * **Target Type:** `Internet Gateway`
    * **Destination CIDR Block:** `0.0.0.0/0`
    * **Compartment:** `your-compartment`
    * **Target Internet Gateway:**  `your-internet-gateway`
    * Click **Add Route Rules**
* Add the service route rule.  Click **Add Route Rules**
    * **Target Type:** `Service Gateway`
    * **Destination Service:** `OCI <region> Object Storage`
    * **Compartment:** `your-compartment`
    * **Target Service Gateway:** `your-service-gateway`
    * Click **Add Route Rules**

### Update the Security List
Open up ports for Hadoop services:
* Click **Security Lists**
* Click **Default Security List for `your-network-name`**
* Add the following Ingress Rules:
    * Click **Add Ingress Rule**
    * Update Source CDR: `0.0.0.0/0`
    * Specify the following **Destination Port Range**: `7183,7182,7180,8888-8890,8090,18088`
    * Click **Add Ingress Rules**
